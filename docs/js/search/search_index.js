API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\nSupport using Fluent API and JSON.\nSupport for nested forms.\nType-safe form configuration.\nBuilt on top of Angular Reactive Forms.\nForm controls and grid layout based on ng-zorro-antd.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nAngular >= 13.0.0\nng-zorro-antd >= 13.0.0\n\nInstall\nnpm i ngx-fluent-formDocs\n\nFor the full API definition, please visit https://hyperlife1119.github.io/ngx-fluent-form.\nOnline examples, and sample code.\n\nUsage\nImport the FluentFormModule into your module:\nimport { FluentFormModule } from 'ngx-fluent-form';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    FluentFormModule\n  ]\n})\nexport class YourModule { }Build the form using the Fluent API:\nimport { date, form, number, text } from 'ngx-fluent-form';\n\n@Component({\n  template: ``\n})\nexport class Component {\n  schema = form(\n    text('text').label('label').placeholder('placeholder').span(6),\n    number('number').label('label').placeholder('placeholder').span(3).max(100),\n    date('date').label('label').placeholder('placeholder').span(6)\n  );\n\n  model = {\n    text: 'fluent-form',\n    number: 10,\n    date: Date.now()\n  };\n}You can also use JSON to build the form:\nimport { AnyControlOptions } from 'ngx-fluent-form';\n\n@Component(...)\nexport class Component {\n  schema: AnyControlOptions[] = [\n    { type: 'text', name: 'text', label: 'label', span: 6 }\n  ];\n}You can also mix Fluent API and JSON:\nimport { AnyControlOptions, number } from 'ngx-fluent-form';\n\n@Component(...)\nexport class Component {\n  schema: AnyControlOptions[] = [\n    { type: 'text', name: 'text', label: 'label', span: 6 },\n    number('number').label('label').placeholder('placeholder').span(3).build(),\n  ];\n}For nested forms, you can use the embed control:\nimport { date, form, number, text, embed, switcher } from 'ngx-fluent-form';\n\n@Component(...)\nexport class Component {\n  schema = form(\n    text('text').label('label').placeholder('placeholder').span(6),\n    number('number').label('label').placeholder('placeholder').span(3).max(100),\n\n    embed('detail').label('detail').span(24).schema(form(\n      date('date').label('label').placeholder('placeholder').span(6),\n      switcher('switch').label('label').span(2),\n    ))\n  );\n\n  model = {\n    text: 'fluent-form',\n    number: 10,\n    detail: {\n      date: Date.now(),\n      switch: true\n    }\n  };\n}Use the `mapper 'option for values that need to be mapped both ways. For example, the date control expects and outputs a'Date 'object, while we expect a date string from the date control output:\nimport { date, form } from 'ngx-fluent-form';\n\n@Component(...)\nexport class Component {\n  schema = form(\n    date('date').label('label').placeholder('placeholder').span(6).mapper({\n      input: (o: string) => new Date(o),\n      output: (o: Date) => [o.getFullYear(), o.getMonth() + 1, o.getDate()].join('-')\n    })\n  );\n\n  model = {\n    date: '2022-2-22'\n  };\n}For range selection controls, such as the range control, it outputs an array with two elements. Suppose we want to map these two elements to two properties:\nimport { form, range } from 'ngx-fluent-form';\n\n@Component(...)\nexport class Component {\n  schema = form(\n    range(['start', 'end']).label('label').span(6),\n  );\n\n  model = {\n    start: null,\n    end: null\n  };\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2022 HyperLifelll9\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
